### Data Exploration

The data contains a record of 1,808 matches played between 29 clubs, from the start of 2015-2016 season up till the [COVID-19 break](https://www.premierleague.com/news/1645173) in 2020.

Due to the concept of promotion and relegation, not all clubs had played an equal amount of matches (fig. 1). To eliminate bias, most analyses were conducted on clubs that had played more or equal to the total average amount of matches played by a club (125).
